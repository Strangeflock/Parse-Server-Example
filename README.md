# Parse-Server-Example
This is an example of a Node.js app running Express where the two main compornents are Parse Dashboard and Parse Server.


This project is a starting point for a self-hosted Parse Server setup. 
The server setup, installation and all necessary steps will be outlined in a blog post I'm currently writing.
